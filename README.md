# No Frills Media Player
## Summary
Flutter app that plays music.
Got sick of Aamazon Music's jank. Downloads are routinely corrupted (especially if they have Dolby Atmos), shuffle play randomly gets enabled sometimes, and it keeps asking me to download over data when I'm on a run. However, I don't want to give up on the audio quality by using Spotify, so I decided I would take this chance to learn flutter and app development.
